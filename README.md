Web Audio and Midi Demo
====================

This web audio / midi demo is originally by Stéphane P. Péricat and so far I have extended it
to include an LFO

##Prerequisites##
 - Google Chrome 39 or above with #enable-web-midi flag activated
 - Some MIDI controller connected to your computer (or just use your keyboard if you don't have one)


##MIDI Devices##

Any MIDI device should be picked up by the demo.

Remember to connect your MIDI device __before__ starting your browser.

##Computer keyboard support##

If you do not own a midi device, you can still test the application using your computer keyboard.
To do so, simply checkout the 'keyboard' branch of this repository. The following keys are mapped:

| Note  | Letter  |
|-------|---------|
|   C   |    a    |
|   C#  |    w    |
|   D   |    s    |
|   D#  |    e    |
|   E   |    d    |
|   F   |    f    |
|   F#  |    t    |
|   G   |    g    |
|   G#  |    y    |
|   A   |    h    |
|   A#  |    u    |
|   B   |    j    |

You can also change octaves:
 - `z` for octave down
 - `x` for octave up
